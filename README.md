# Proof Of Existence

Hi, this is a small project that use [__opentimestamps__](https://opentimestamps.org/). It's an API that allows you to stamp and verify files on bitcoin blockchain, also you can do some cool stuff.

Clone the repo, fill the [__env variables__](./.env.sample) and then run:

```
  npm i
  npm start
```
Running on port 3000. 
Docs on `api/docs`.
In the future, I'm going to create a docker image.
